BabyEnigma is a simple, console-based encryption tool, written in Java. It is an extremely simple program and was created primarily to help me learn coding. BabyEnigma takes a keyphrase, turns it into an integer (the key) and adds this to each character in the string/file, thereby scrambling it. Files encrypted by BabyEnigma are stored with a .be file extension and are decrypted with  .txt file extension. This is NOT A SECURE ENCRYPTION and can be easily broken. I have broken the encryption myself, without knowing the keyphrase. It should therefore not be used to store personal information - it is merely a fun little tool.
