# BabyEnigma
## *Simple console-based string and file encryption tool*
### Version: 2.1
### Author: Samuel Brookes (@sjb-ch1mp)

BabyEnigma is a simple, console-based encryption tool, written in Java. It is an extremely simple program and was created primarily to help me learn coding. BabyEnigma takes a keyphrase, turns it into an integer (the key) and adds this to each character in the string/file, thereby creating a ciphertext. Files encrypted by BabyEnigma are stored with a .be file extension and are decrypted with  .txt file extension. This is NOT A SECURE ENCRYPTION and can be easily broken. I have broken the encryption myself, without knowing the keyphrase. It should therefore not be used to store personal information - it is merely a fun little tool.

### Updates 
#### 2.1: Added simple command-line interface and debugged.
